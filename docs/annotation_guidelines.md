# Annotation Guidelines

## Goal
To classify private companies into precise product line categories for improved ML model training.

## Instructions
1. Read company business descriptions thoroughly.
2. Match them to the most granular category in the taxonomy.
3. Flag companies that donâ€™t fit cleanly into any existing category.
4. Use consistent labeling practices to avoid duplicate representations.

## Edge Cases
- For multi-category companies, label the primary revenue driver.
- If unsure, add a comment in the `Reviewer_Notes` field.
