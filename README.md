# Private Market ML Annotation Workflow

This project demonstrates my hands-on experience with managing an ML data annotation pipeline for private market company classification. From defining annotation standards to refining taxonomies and feeding data into AWS SageMaker, this repo captures the full lifecycle of data management for AI model development.

## Key Contributions
- Designed and managed the end-to-end data annotation process for model training.
- Analyzed model inference results to detect misclassifications.
- Refined and extended taxonomies for improved ML performance.
- Implemented data validation checks and prepared master data handoffs for retraining.
- Collaborated with engineers and data leadership to integrate updates in AWS SageMaker.

## Folders
- `data/` - Sample data snippets (anonymized)
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for validation and taxonomy prep
- `taxonomy/` - Updated classification structure
- `docs/` - Annotation standards and workflow diagrams
