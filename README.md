# Private Market ML Annotation Workflow

This project documents a real-world ML data operations workflow I led for a private markets dataset. It showcases how annotation, taxonomy refinement, and model evaluation were combined to support classification model accuracy for private company product line data.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

The goal was to improve ML classification accuracy for private company product line detection. This involved managing annotation operations, refining classification taxonomies, validating model inference data, and working with engineering to update training data on AWS SageMaker.

## ðŸ’¼ My Role

- Managed an AI data annotation project end-to-end
- Refined and optimized taxonomies for classification consistency
- Created validation logic for improving data quality
- Reviewed model inference results to identify training data gaps
- Handed off updated master data to the engineering team for retraining

## ðŸ”§ Tech & Tools

- Python (for scripts and validation)
- Pandas
- AWS SageMaker (via handoff)
- Excel / Google Sheets (QA and tracking)
- Git & GitHub (version control)

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome

The improved taxonomy and validation pipeline led to a measurable improvement in classification accuracy and significantly reduced label ambiguity, strengthening the training dataset's foundation for future ML iterations.

# Private Market ML Annotation Workflow

This project demonstrates my hands-on experience with managing an ML data annotation pipeline for private market company classification. From defining annotation standards to refining taxonomies and feeding data into AWS SageMaker, this repo captures the full lifecycle of data management for AI model development.

## Key Contributions
- Designed and managed the end-to-end data annotation process for model training.
- Analyzed model inference results to detect misclassifications.
- Refined and extended taxonomies for improved ML performance.
- Implemented data validation checks and prepared master data handoffs for retraining.
- Collaborated with engineers and data leadership to integrate updates in AWS SageMaker.
